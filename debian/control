Description: Java framework implementing the OSGi R6 version
 OSGi, Open Service Gateway Initiative, specifies an industry standard Java
 application platform, allowing multiple applications, to securely run in a
 single JVM. These programs can share resources as data, functionality and
 threads.
 .
 Applications areas for OSGi ranges from use as a service platform on embedded
 devices, to plugin mechanisms for larger programs. The initial goal of OSGi
 was the embedded market, but other uses are certainly possible.
 .
 This package specifically provides the framework JAR file.
